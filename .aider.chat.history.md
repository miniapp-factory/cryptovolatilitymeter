#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

I can update the metadata file, but I also need the logo description file to be added to the chat.  
Please add a new file at:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

with the contents you want for the logo image. Once that file is added, I’ll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` so I can create an exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block that updates the `title` and `description`.  
Please add that file to the chat. Once I have it, I’ll also provide a block that creates `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` with a suitable logo description.
